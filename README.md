## Description:
A cricket tournament scheduling software that can schedule a cricket tournament randomly without any bias towards any team​

## Key Features:
**Automated Scheduling:** The software could automate the schedule process without much human effort. ​

**Flexibility:** There are two default tournament types ( World Cup and IPL ) and there is also a custom tournament option. The schedule is based on Round – robin format.​

**Reliability on scheduling:** There is no bias towards any team. The entire schedule is randomly generated without any bias towards any team.​

**Dynamic Date Management:** The program dynamically manages tournament dates, ensuring that matches are scheduled in a chronological and organized manner, when the user inputs a given date.​

## Technologies Used:
Used C language for coding. Included in-built libraries like stdio.h, stdlib.h, time.h.
